### Project setup

If you just cloned the project, do this first:

```
npm install
```

(Of course, if you didn't install npm, you have to install it)

#### Start Debug Web Server

```
npm run serve
```

#### Other Notes

Sources are in `./src/`, other files are config or envirmental files. Also ignore `main.ts`, `shims...d.ts`. Those are auto-generated files. Main game logic are in `./src/logic/`.
